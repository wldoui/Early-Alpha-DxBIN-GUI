# [Early-Alpha] DxBIN.GUI

**Fake GUI to hack the userðŸ˜¨**

This graphical window is designed to make the user/"victim" believe that you are not trying to hack it, in other words, it's a common scam, the gui itself does not carry any viruses or spywars created (so far) only to overturn people who don't know anything about computers. I don't know what else to write, it's just a GUI Â¯\(ãƒ„)/Â¯

Mini instruction : 0_0 You can make a bat file put a compiled file of this gui in there and some rat virus, talked the user into it to open the botnick, so the user won't realize he just got infected.

How GUI works.

It's quite simple, because as I said it's just a GUI with a doxbin style. If any number that is 12 characters long is entered into it, the GUI will show that no phone number data wasn't found. Otherwise it will just give an error.

Now live with it.
